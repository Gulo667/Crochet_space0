This project is created for my small personal business called crochet_space0
as a hobby, I make handmade product by crochetting. not long ago I got the idea to
create a website for it, which will also help me to deepen my knowledge and practise with 
coding Python, using Django, create frontend and backend all by my own with the help of internet resources.
