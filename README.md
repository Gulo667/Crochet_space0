This project is created for my small personal business called crochet_space0.
As a hobby, I make handmade crochetting product. not long ago I got the idea to
create a website for it, which would also help me to deepen my knowledge and practise with 
coding Python, using Django, creating frontend and backend all by my own with the help of internet resources.
